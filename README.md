42 is the first digital training center that is entirely free and available to students with or without degrees who are 18-years or older. Its teaching methods are based upon peer-to-peer learning: classless, teacherless, and participatory, 42 allows students to free their creativity through project learning.

This folder contains all of my projects for my time at 42. 42 projects are tracked by using the "holy graph", which starts with the first project at the center of the graph, then moving outwards, so students have more choice and freedom over which projects they complete. The inner circles are called the "common core" curriculum and must be completed by all 42 students. Once completed, students can specialize in one or more of the outer branches.

I am extremely grateful I have had the opportunity to be part of this network and for all I have learned while studying here. If it hadn't been for 42, I might have never had the continuous drive to learn a challenging topic such as programming and software engineering.
