# Push Swap

## Project
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.
Your goal ? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.

## Instructions

The game is composed of 2 stacks named a and b. â€¢ To start with:
* the stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.
* b is empty
* The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a.
* To do this you have the following operations at your disposal:
* sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
* sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
* ss : sa and sb at the same time.
* pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
* nothing if b is empty.
* pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
* nothing if a is empty.
* ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
* the last one.
* rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
* rr : ra and rb at the same time.
* rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
